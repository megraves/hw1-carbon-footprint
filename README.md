# hw1-carbon-footprint

App Feature Description:

Customizable UI - Click the sun/moon in the top left corner. It will toggle between light and dark mode.
Activity Log - This is the leftmost card, but my implementation kind of failed miserably. My idea was that users could input an activity that they completed, and the activities would be listed below on the card.
Summary - This is the middle card, this was going to have a chart that tracked the number of activities completed during the week. Since I could not get the activity log working properly, this was also a fail.
Goal Tracker - This is the rightmost card. Users can input a goal and a target number that they want to reach. (i.e. I want to use 10 other forms of transportation instead of my car this week). On submission, the users can track the number of times they have contributed to their goal, each stage involving encouraging messages.
Resource Library - At the bottom, there are tons of tips and tricks that the users can read through for ideas and inspiration in their journey to reducing their carbon footprint.
